# SwiftAsyncSocket

A package that aims to make the experience of implementing an asynchronous socket library written in Swift.



This project is based off of the [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) and [SwiftAsnycSocket](https://github.com/chouheiwa/SwiftAsnycSocket) packages.

The CocoaAsyncSocket package was converted to Swift by Chouheiwa and packaged on Github as [SwiftAsnycSocket](https://github.com/chouheiwa/SwiftAsnycSocket).

This package was forked from SwiftAsnycSocket on 1st Sept 2024.
